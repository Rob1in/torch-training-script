# Dataset paths
# Each directory must contain: dataset.jsonl + data/ (with images)
# Example structure:
#   my_dataset/
#     dataset.jsonl
#     data/
#       image1.jpg
#       image2.jpg
data:
  train_dir: null   # Required: directory containing dataset.jsonl + data/
  val_dir: null     # Optional: if null, auto-split from train_dir (see training.val_split)
  test_dir: null    # Optional: for eval.py (eval.py uses dataset_dir CLI arg instead)

# Transform configuration
# Note: Transforms are applied via GPUCollate in the dataloader BEFORE model.forward()
#
# NORMALIZATION: DO NOT add Normalize here!
# All torchvision detection models (Faster R-CNN, SSDLite) have a built-in
# GeneralizedRCNNTransform that handles normalization AND resize internally.
# Adding Normalize here would cause DOUBLE normalization → broken model output.
#
# RESIZE: Keep Resize here for batching.
# Images in a batch must be the same size for torch.stack(). The model's internal
# transform will then see already-resized images and essentially skip its own resize.
#
# AUGMENTATIONS: Add augmentations here (flip, rotation, jitter, etc.)
# The model does NOT do augmentations — that's the dataloader's job.
#
# RECOMMENDATION:
#   - Set model.transform.input_size to match the model's expected size
#   - Faster R-CNN pretrained: [800, 1333]
#   - SSDLite pretrained: [320, 320]
#   - Training from scratch: Any size you want
